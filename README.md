# Hardspace: Shipbreaker UI Demo
#### By Melissa Autumn 

This reactjs app is a 3-day test of my skills. Since I felt like I was getting a little rusty, I sought out to re-create some HUD elements from the video game [Hardspace: Shipbreaker](https://www.hardspace-shipbreaker.com/) by [BlackBird Interactive](https://blackbirdinteractive.com/).

The original goal was to re-create and animate the HUD elements, however I kind of ran out of time near the end. Hence, some later components are a bit hard-coded. Still, I had quite a bit of fun building this out. Hope someone out there enjoys it!

# Building

View the gameplay screen with all the HUD elements in place with: `yarn start`

View each individual component in isolation thanks to StoryBook with: `yarn storybook`

You can build the app with: `yarn build`
